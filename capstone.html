<h2>-HIS LITTLE SWEETHEART-</h2>

The person he longs to meet always,</br>
Perhaps the sole one he wishes to gaze;</br>
Even for a moment can't drift apart,</br>
She is none other than his Little Sweetheart.</br>
<br>

An Epitome amongst the Fickle girls,</br>
She's the one who neither Rages nor Hurls;</br>
Anger though is Tipped on her Nose,</br>
But Consoling her had become his habitual Course.</br>
<br>

Just a small Glance of her Colossal Smile, </br>
Relieves all the Stresses for a little while;</br>
Her madness, witty Jokes and all Crazy stuff,</br>
Is all he needs at night, for his Tired mind to Bluff.</br>
<br>

A Chest, full of Talks & Memories she is,</br>
With loads of hundred Ever-Lasting Topics;</br>
But now with each day adding to the  Almanac,</br>
New Promisinng Memories in future to throwback.</br>
<br>

Dangerous she is, if with her you Mess,</br>
Just a 'Sam-stare' will get you in distress;</br>
Truly speaking, She's a lot Polite and Humble,</br>
For she accepts any damn thing without a Grumble.</br>
<br>

Making things look simple and with Ease she does,</br>
Without losing her Calm but with a constant buzz;</br>
Always willing to Lend a hand to a needy; while;</br>
She just loves to be their Reason of smile.</br>
<br>

Filled with Naughtiness & Adventurous in nature,</br>
Always on her Toes to get on a Venture;</br>
She's his little girl with Heck lots of Dislikes,</br>
With his opnions always Countering her Likes.</br>
<br>

Careless she is as far as Health is concerned,</br>
But hugely Affectionate and Caring towards her beloved person;</br>
This is all about his Sweetheart, who's a Gem of a girl,</br>
And he'll treat her just as an Oyster treats a Pearl..!</br>
