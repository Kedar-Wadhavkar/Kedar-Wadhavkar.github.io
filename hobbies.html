			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cherishing a hobby like an art & craft one, immensely edifies oneself. For me, it's but a pleasure, deriving eternal contention and satisfaction. Being an artistic craftsman has comprehensively developed in me a lot of creativity. Aiming to create every piece of craft a masterpiece, perfectionism is what, is being carved in me over the years.</p>

<h2>-HIS JOURNEY TOWARDS HIS LOVE-</h2>

She didn't believe in love,<br>
It's charming & beautiful as a dove;<br>
He wanted a relationship very late,<br>
She thought being single was in her fate.<br>
<br>

It was a day when he made her realize,<br>
That there isn't a better feeling than love to apprize;<br>
The next day when he confessed, he loved her,<br>
She was on the ninth cloud, even more happier.<br>
<br>

Days kept rolling one after the other, <br>
Building their relation more firm & stronger;<br>
With many sweet moments coming their way,<br>
Making each day more exotic and gay.<br>
<br>

Until an evening after a long hectic day,<br>
She exclaimed that something she wanted to say;<br>
She's in love with him, she expressed blushing,<br>
The truth beneath her eyes was just overwhelming.<br>
<br>

It was the moment most awaited for,<br>
He just couldn't believe what he'd heard so far;<br>
Yeah, said she with a huge blushed smile,<br>
Which drove him to heaven for a little while.<br>
<br>

Since then his life changed its priority,<br>
With all his dreams transforming into reality;<br>
Morning till night with each other,<br>
They ceaselessly chattered whatsoever.<br>
<br>

One day she'll propose him for sure though,<br>
Perhaps keeps him waiting, as a sign of true love;<br>
But they'd certainly be in a relation-ship soon,<br>
A Ship on a voyage of life, with a honey and a moon..!<br>

<h2>-HIS LITTLE SWEETHEART-</h2>
	
The person he longs to meet always,</br>
Perhaps the sole one he wishes to gaze;</br>
Even for a moment can't drift apart,</br>
She is none other than his little sweetheart.</br>
<br>

An epitome amongst the fickle girls,</br>
She's the one who neither rages nor hurls;</br>
Anger though is tipped on her nose,</br>
But consoling her had become his habitual course.</br>
<br>

Just a small glance of her colossal smile, </br>
Relieves all the stresses for a little while;</br>
Her madness, witty jokes and all crazy stuff,</br>
Is all he needs at night, for his tired mind to bluff.</br>
<br>

A chest, full of talks & memories she is,</br>
With loads of hundred ever-lasting topics;</br>
But now with each day adding to the  almanac,</br>
New promisinng memories in future to throwback.</br>
<br>

Making things look simple and with ease she does,</br>
Without losing her calm but with a constant buzz;</br>
Always willing to lend a hand to a needy; while;</br>
She just loves to be their reason of smile.</br>
<br>

Filled with naughtiness & adventurous in nature,</br>
Always on her toes to get on a venture;</br>
She's his little girl with heck lots of dislikes,</br>
With his opnions always countering her likes.</br>
<br>

Careless she is as far as health is concerned,</br>
But hugely affectionate and caring towards her beloved person;</br>
This is all about his sweetheart, who's a gem of a girl,</br>
And he'll treat her just as an oyster treats a pearl..!</br>

<br>

One day she'll propose him for sure though,<br>
Perhaps keeps him waiting, as a sign of true love;<br>
But they'd certainly be in a relation-ship soon,<br>
A Ship on a voyage of life, with a honey and a moon..!<br>

<h2>-HIS LITTLE SWEETHEART-</h2>
	
The person he longs to meet always,</br>
Perhaps the sole one he wishes to gaze;</br>
Even for a moment can't drift apart,</br>
She is none other than his little sweetheart.</br>
<br>

An epitome amongst the fickle girls,</br>
She's the one who neither rages nor hurls;</br>
Anger though is tipped on her nose,</br>
But consoling her had become his habitual course.</br>
<br>

Just a small glance of her colossal smile, </br>
Relieves all the stresses for a little while;</br>
Her madness, witty jokes and all crazy stuff,</br>
Is all he needs at night, for his tired mind to bluff.</br>
<br>

A chest, full of talks & memories she is,</br>
With loads of hundred ever-lasting topics;</br>
But now with each day adding to the  almanac,</br>
New promisinng memories in future to throwback.</br>
<br>

Making things look simple and with ease she does,</br>
Without losing her calm but with a constant buzz;</br>
Always willing to lend a hand to a needy; while;</br>
She just loves to be their reason of smile.</br>
<br>

Filled with naughtiness & adventurous in nature,</br>
Always on her toes to get on a venture;</br>
She's his little girl with heck lots of dislikes,</br>
With his opnions always countering her likes.</br>
<br>

Careless she is as far as health is concerned,</br>
But hugely affectionate and caring towards her beloved person;</br>
This is all about his sweetheart, who's a gem of a girl,</br>
And he'll treat her just as an oyster treats a pearl..!</br>

<h2>-HIS JOURNEY TOWARDS HIS LOVE-</h2>

She didn't believe in love,<br>
It's charming & beautiful as a dove;<br>
He wanted a relationship very late,<br>
She thought being single was in her fate.<br>
<br>

It was a day when he made her realize,<br>
That there isn't a better feeling than love to apprize;<br>
The next day when he confessed, he loved her,<br>
She was on the ninth cloud, even more happier.<br>
<br>

Days kept rolling one after the other, <br>
Building their relation more firm & stronger;<br>
With many sweet moments coming their way,<br>
Making each day more exotic and gay.<br>
<br>

Until an evening after a long hectic day,<br>
She exclaimed that something she wanted to say;<br>
She's in love with him, she expressed blushing,<br>
The truth beneath her eyes was just overwhelming.<br>
<br>

It was the moment most awaited for,<br>
He just couldn't believe what he'd heard so far;<br>
Yeah, said she with a huge blushed smile,<br>
Which drove him to heaven for a little while.<br>
<br>

Since then his life changed its priority,<br>
With all his dreams transforming into reality;<br>
Morning till night with each other,<br>
They ceaselessly chattered whatsoever.<br>
<br>

One day she'll propose him for sure though,<br>
Perhaps keeps him waiting, as a sign of true love;<br>
But they'd certainly be in a relation-ship soon,<br>
A Ship on a voyage of life, with a honey and a moon..!<br>
