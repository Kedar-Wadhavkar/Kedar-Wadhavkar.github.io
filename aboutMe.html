	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>W</strong>ith an ever-inquisitive mind, I keep edifying myself pushing my limits. I believe that learning is unbounded and that our mind is an ideal blackbody absorbing the rays of knowledge approaching it. Although being a mechanical engineer, a multi-disciplinary attitude allures me. I have significantly worked in various domains viz. designing, shop floor (manufacturing), analytics (FMECA), marketing, web development, mechatronics and machine learning. Experiencing multiple domains, arose in me numerous skillsets– each embossing a remarkable impression in its proficiency. Having profoundly contributed in different teams for different projects, many soft-skills as well have significantly evolved over the years. Leading from the front, balancing all the responsibilities and yet producing the best, is what gives me an edge. My vision has always been to keep persevering until perfectionism and that what gets created should be a masterpiece of its kind. Being organized and disciplined are one of my finest qualities that give me a boon to handle multiple tasks in short spans. Being ambitious and driven, I consistently thrive on challenges occasionally setting short-time as well as long-time targets. I’m of the opinion that success is always within the reach– only if the goal is determinedly worked upon with utter devotion and dedication.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Web design</strong> encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>
